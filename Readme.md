**Title: Proposing the Adoption of Snowflake IDs as Unique Identifiers**

**Introduction:**

We propose the adoption of Snowflake IDs as our new unique identifier system, replacing our current reliance on MongoDB and UUIDs. This proposal aligns with our organization's need for a more efficient and scalable solution.

**The Problem:**

Our current dependency on MongoDB and UUIDs introduces challenges, including dependencies on external systems, increased network costs, and non-sortable identifiers. These issues hinder our scalability and data organization efforts.

**Solution:**

To address these challenges, we propose adopting Snowflake IDs. Snowflake IDs are composed of a timestamp, worker number, and sequence number, providing scalability, ordering, and a 64-bit size that meets our unique identifier system's requirements.

**How Snowflake IDs are Formed:**

- A Snowflake ID consists of three components:
    1. **Timestamp:** Represents the time when the ID is generated.
    2. **Worker Number:** Identifies the machine or data center.
    3. **Sequence Number:** Ensures uniqueness even within the same millisecond.

**Example:**

A Snowflake ID might look like this: `1635723461022734`

- The first part, `16357234610`, represents the timestamp.
- The second part, `22`, is the worker number.
- The third part, `734`, is the sequence number.

This numeric format simplifies the representation of the Snowflake ID while maintaining clarity.

**Benefits:**

1. **Independence from External Dependencies:** Snowflake IDs eliminate dependencies on external systems, reducing network overhead and enhancing reliability.

2. **Sortable IDs:** Snowflake IDs are roughly sortable, facilitating efficient data organization and retrieval.

**Technical Details:**

- Implementing Snowflake IDs will involve integrating a Snowflake ID generation library into our stack.
- A distributed unique ID generator will ensure global uniqueness.

**Implementation Plan:**

1. Evaluate and select a suitable Snowflake ID generation library.
2. Integrate the library into our applications and services.
3. Update data storage to use Snowflake IDs as primary keys.
4. Train the team on the new identifier format.
5. Gradually migrate existing data to Snowflake IDs.


**Challenges and Risks:**

1. **Migrating existing data:** The transition to Snowflake IDs may require careful planning and execution to ensure a seamless migration of existing data.

2. **Ensuring uniqueness in a distributed system:** Maintaining the uniqueness of Snowflake IDs across a distributed environment is a critical challenge.

3. **Worker ID assignment:** Deciding how to assign worker IDs poses a challenge. Options include using environment variables, ZooKeeper, RabbitMQ, Kubernetes StatefulSets, or MAC addresses. Each method has its considerations and may require specific implementation strategies.

**Conclusion:**

The adoption of Snowflake IDs offers a robust solution that eliminates dependencies on external systems, reduces network costs, and provides sortable IDs. This transition is a strategic move for our organization's technical infrastructure.
